        <p>This is a page I set up some time ago to dump my thoughts onto.</p>
        <p>Mostly just to rage about stuff going on in this country</p>
        <p>I tried to get an Epipen the other day for an allergy. OVER 400$. That is ridiculous. There are more "affordable" ones but lets be serious. I shouldn't be paying over $100 for them.</p>
        <p>One thing I think is super unethical is that pharmaceutical companies do it "Patent Thicket". This is where they wait to file patents they on medicine to prevent generics from being made.</p> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3583" target="_blank">
            View Senate Bill 3583 on Congress.gov</a>
            <p> A bill was introduced, but it didn't go anywhere.<p>
